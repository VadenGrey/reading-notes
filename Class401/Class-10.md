**Stacks and Queues**

Common terminology for a stack is

Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
Top - This is the top of the stack.
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

FILO
First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

LIFO
Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

Think of a pile of plates that need to be washed


Common terminology for a queue is

Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

FIFO
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

LILO
