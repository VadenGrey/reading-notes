# Growth Mindset

**Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice**

    Deliberate practice can improve upon your skillset by pushing you outside your comfort zone because after a year of making websites thats all you're going to be good at and when a new problem show up you're stuck on it for hours. Throught deliberate practice you are constantly challenging yourself to improve upon areas you are lacking skill in, so when major problems show up you already have the mindset of tackling it.

**Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset**

    Believing that you can improve is the first part of improving, because if you dont you never will.

**Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit**

    Having grit is having stamina to stick with what you want to do in life and having the perserverance to follow through with life goals.

**Alain de Botton on Redefining Success**

    In order to be successful you have to factor in where the loss is, because you cant be successful at everything, so in realizing where you want to succeed you have to have the disipline of letting go of the things you will lose in that process of success.

**Assessing emotional intelligence**

    After taking the emotional intelligence self assessment my strongest area was self management while my weakest was social awareness. In the coming months I can frequently come back to this assessment and see how I am doing and later on take it again to see where I have improved.

**Assessing biases**

    After taking the biases self assessment my stronngest area was Meaningful connections while my weakest was four ways to act. In the coming months I can frequently come back to this assessment and see how I am doing and later on take it again to see where I have improved.
