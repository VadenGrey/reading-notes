**Django Custom User Model**

Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication and if you'd like a basic tutorial on how to implement log in, log out, sign up and so on see the Django Login and Logout tutorial for more. However, for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line so, as a general rule, always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.

**DjangoX**

DjangoX comes with a custom user model by default, email/password authentication instead of Djangoâ€™s default and outdated username/email/password pattern, and is fully extendable with social authentication like Gmail, Facebook, and more.
