**What is Serverless Computing?**

Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

What serverless computing offers:
- Improved developer productivity - more time writing code for the front-end than developing infrastructure
- Pay for execution only - The meter starts when the request is made, and ends when execution finishes
- Develop in any language
- Streamlined development/DevOps cycles - spend no time defining infrastructure required to integrate, test, deliver and deploy code builds into production.
- Cost-effective performance
- Usage visibility - Serverless platforms provide near-total visibility into system and user times and can aggregate usage information systematically.
