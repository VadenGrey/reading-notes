**Intro to Django**

[Object-relational mapper](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/models/) - Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free, but you can still write SQL if needed.

[URLs and views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/urls/) - A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web application. Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp. To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.

[Templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/templates/) - Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

[Forms](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/forms/) - Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

[Authentication](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/auth/) - Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

[Admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/) - One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site. It’s easy to set up and provides many hooks for customization.

[Internationalization](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/i18n/) - Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones. It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize web applications for particular users according to their preferences.

[Security](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/security/) - Django provides multiple protections against: Clickjacking, Cross-site scripting, Cross Site Request Forge(CSRF), SQL injection, Remote code execution


**How Django Works Behind the Scenes**

Django is an open source Python-based web framework. Django was originally developed at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss. Django has a small, core team of trusted volunteers who work alongside the Django Fellows to manage technical side of the Django Project. The Django Software Foundation supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities.

**What is Tailwind CSS?**

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier. You can use utility classes to control the layout, color, spacing, typography, shadows, and more to create a completely custom component design — without leaving your HTML or writing a single line of custom CSS, basically Tailwind CSS is a framework for quickly building and customizing applications without writing custom CSS.
