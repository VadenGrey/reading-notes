# Practice in the Terminal

**The Command Line**
The command line is where you execute your commands in the terminal

**Basic Navigation**
pwd(print working directory) - prints where you are at: home/user/foldername
ls(list) - lists what files are in the current directory
cd(change directory) - moves you to the directory you choose relative to the path

**More About Files**
When trying to access or manipulate files know that the names are CaSe SeNsEtIvE. some file types are .txt(a text file), 
.png(image file), .exe(executable, or program)

**Manual Pages**
man (command to look up) - brings up a manual for the command, useful and easy to bring up if you want more information on a specific command

**File Manipulation**
mkdir (make directory) - makes a directory(folder) relative to the path you are at
rmdir (remove directory) - removes a directory(folder) relative to the path you are at, also the directory must be empty before it can be removed
