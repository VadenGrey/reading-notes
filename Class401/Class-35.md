**Graphs**

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
