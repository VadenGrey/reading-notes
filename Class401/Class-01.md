Todays reading assignment goes over the mindset you need to have while taking this course and an introduction to big O notation

**Pain Vs. Suffering**
Suffering is pain without purpose, in the coming weeks the course will be intesive while being emotionally, mentally and physically exhausting. When in pain think about: why you are doing this?, whats your perspective?, do you want what comes at the end of this journey?, and are you doing this for you?

**Big O notation**
Big O notation is used to describe the perfermance or complexity of an algorithm, the 4 notations are:

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 

O(NÂ²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
