**Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency**

Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity) - The amount of time a function needs to complete.

Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity) - The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

When deducing what the limiting factors think about these 4 things:

1. Input Size
2. Units of Measurement
3. Orders of Growth
4. Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

**Linked Lists**

A linked list is a data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list with which you can traverse by using the Next property that points to the next node in the linked list.

**What’s a Linked List, Anyway**

A linear data structure such as a list, you traverse through elements/nodes sequentially, while in a non-linear data structure like a tree, one node might be connected to several other nodes so it cant always be traversed sequentially. The main difference between linear and non-linear is how they store and use memory.
