**Encryption, Decryption & Hacking**

Encryption is when a message is scrambled so that only the recipient or anyone with the key can read the message, decryption is where the key to the message is used to decode the contents of the message, and hacking is when you decipher the message by brute force, frequency analysis, and known plaintext.

**Ceasar Cipher**

The Ceasar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
