If you act like you make $1000/hr why waste time on petty things? Being busy doenst neccessarally mean being productive with your time, you are making $1000/hr afterall. Take note of what you did every week, was it worth the time or a waste of time?

The first part in thinking like a programmer is understanding problems. if you cant explain the problem in plain english then you dont understand it. The second step is to plan, dont jump right into a problem without having a game plan. 3rd step is to divide the the problem into smaller segments so that its easier to work on. 4th step is when you get stuck is first take a break then comeback debug and reassess. Final step is practice, because you wont become an expert after just one week.

## Discussion questions

One thing I can bring to my career (and potential employer) that no one else can is perserverance, which that skill is constantly improving.

Some things I can do to un-stick myself from a problem is:
1. reassess - if I am doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result then its definitely time for a reassessment
2. Take a 15 min break - there has been many times where I would be stuck on a problem, take a break and get my mind completely off of the subject, only to come back and immediatly fix the problem
3. Research - There is a huge chance that someone out there has had the exact same problem and wrote about how they solved it, if not then there are other fantastic resources to look at.
