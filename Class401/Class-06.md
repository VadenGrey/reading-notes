**How to use Random Module**
The randint() function which is defined in the python random module can be used to create random strings within a range. The function takes two numbers as its input argument. The first input argument is the start of the range and the second input argument is the end of the range.

```python
import random
print(random.randint(0, 5))
```

**What is Risk Analysis**

Risk analysis is self-explanatory as its assessing what your risks are:
Use of new hardware
Use of new technology
Use of new automation tool
The sequence of code
Availability of test resources for the application

**Test Coverage**

Test coverage is how much is your tests covering what your code can do, and it can be easy to write code that specifically passes the test

**Big O Notation**

Big O is how time and space scale with respect to some input variables
