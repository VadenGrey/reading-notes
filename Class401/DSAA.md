# Data Structures and Algorithms

**Basic Recursion**

Recursion problems can solved either by using the best case(while loop) or a recursive case(code that calls upon itself)

**Data Structures in 15 Minutes**

A data structure is how data is stored and there can be benefits or downsides to organizing data in certain ways>
Linked Lists - data is stored in nodes and nodes only know other nodes besides them, it can add and delete new data really fast however it is slow at data retrieval.
Array - an array or list in python is excellent at retrieving data but sometimes adding a lot of data can cause problems.
Hash Table - like an array but can take more data at the risk of a collision, where two keys can hash to the same memory location.
Stack & Queue - a stack is a last in first out data structure. a queue is first in first out, both are efficient at adding and removing but have limited use cases.
Graphs + Trees - A graph is similiar to a linked list, a common hiearchical graph is a tree where data expands out in one direction

**Big O Explained**

O(n) linear - speed is dependant on how large the input is.
O(a+b) - if multiple different steps are required.

8 Common Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Heaps, and Graphs

**Why Big O**

Big O is just the name of the notation used to describe how efficient an algorithm is

## Discussion questions

One of the more important things to consider when deciding on which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is efficiency

The easiest way to avoid an infinite recursive call stack is to write a substitue function that does the same thing but doesnt call upon itself
