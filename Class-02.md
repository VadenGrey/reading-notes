# Testing and Modules

Test driven development is extremely useful and proven to improve learning. Me personally I like to see my code fail immediatly instead of 10 mins from when I wrote it

**TDD with Python**

Writing tests to make sure your code does what you want it to can save a tremendous amount of time

**If name equals main**

if __name__ == __main__ then it will execute when invoked directly, if not then the script is executed when imported

**Recursion**

Recursion in programming is mainly when a function calls upon itself, in order to not have it become an infinite loop just declare a condition that, when met, will break the recursion. Having a function call upon itself can make code look more sleek and easier to read.
