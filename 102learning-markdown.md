# Learning markdown

Markdown is a lighter version of HTML and honestly easier to use

## Advantages of using markdown instead of HTML
- Fast to write
- low learning curve
- the code is better to look at

## How markdown is different from HTML
For starters the file extension is different (.md) and the "tags" you use are different aswell as seen in the examples below:

Let's say i wanted to make a heading in HTML i would write:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>this is a heading</h1>
</html>
```

In markdown I would simply write:

```
# this is a heading
```
