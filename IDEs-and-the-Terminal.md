# Text Editor and IDE's
Programming begins with writing code, a way to do this is to open a text file and get started.

A better way to do this is to use an IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) so that you can use powerful tools not available in a simple text file such as:
- Extensions - you can have even more coding tools than what the IDE offers.
- Syntax highlighting - makes your code easier to understand by highlighting syntax of your code.
- Code completion - writing code with code completion gives suggestions on what to write making the coding process faster.
- Themes - staring at a screen all day puts strain on the eyes so making the theme darker would lessen that.
- Shows Errors - unlike a text editor, IDE's show errors which is extremely helpful in writing productive code that works.

So programming with an IDE is the way to go unless you're looking for a challenge then go ahead and use a text editor

## The Terminal

The Terminal (specifically a Linux terminal)(AKA the command line) is a text based interface to your system where you can interact with your files without the GUI

What you have with a terminal is a shell which is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will lok and behave after executing your commands, the most common shell is called bash (bourne again shell)

Some Basic commands:
```
Pwd - print working directory (shows what directory you are currently in)
Ls - list (list programs in terminal)
Cd - change directory 
Mkdir - make directory (make new folder)
Clear - (clears the terminal)
Touch - (creates a file)
Tree - (makes a "tree" from files in the terminal)

```

## Navigating through the terminal
Where am i? pwd
```
User@bash: pwd
```
