This note section covers: HTML links, CSS positioning, and JS functions whichare the next steps in learning more of the fundamentals

**HTML**

1. an anchor tag

    ```
    <a></a>
    ```

2. the hyperlink reference attribute contaions the link

    ```
    <a href="www.website.com"></a>
    ```

3. giving it a title so if the link goes down the reader will get an idea of what was there


**CSS**

1. the way the website normally lays things out if you havent changed anything

2. Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element

3. static positioning is the default

4. you can create isolated features for something like popups

5. absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport

**JS**

1. A function declaration describes what the function does while invoking it cause that function to run
2. A parameter is a named variable passed into a function while an argument is a value passed as input to a function.
