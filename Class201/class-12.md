Chart.js seems to be a very powerful tool, that I will definatley try to implement in future projects

**JS Canvas**
1. allows you to draw 2d graphics using JS
2. because the content inside of the canvas tag is used as fallback
3. it accesses the drawing context

**Chart.js Documentation**
1. its used to show data charts like a bar chart
2. bar, pie, and line charts

**Animated Charts**
1. because with chart, there are more ways to accurately display datasets
2. by making it easier to display data
