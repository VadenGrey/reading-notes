The reading notes today are important because it shows that erroneous code is bound to happen and shows insight on how to fix it

**What went wrong?**
1. syntax errors come from mistyped code, and logic errors come from the code running incorrectly
2. syntax errors are easy to fix but the logic errors require work. I usually google search how to do it or try a different approach
3. itll help me to keep in mind that troubleshooting is a natural part of the coding process and not to get too frustrated

**JS debugger**
1. It makes correcting JS logic and syntax errors easier
2. places in your code where you want to stop it executing
3. it shows what code was executed to get to the line you are on
