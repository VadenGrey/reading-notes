**HTML**

1. alt tag can be used for accessability for screen readers
2. give proper context of what the image is within the context
3. when a website references a specific image in text, so it can be looked at
4. a gif is used for a short animation while an svg is used for images that need to scale accurately  
5. a png, because other formats compress the img and could lead to quality loss

3. readability
