These notes and references will be useful for making css layout faster and simpler
**CSS-flexbox**
1. it only deals with content in one diretion at a single time
2. in terms of a graph the main axis would be x, while the cross axis would be y
3. an exapmle would be row-reverse and column-reverse reorders the content visually not logically

**CSS layout-flexbox**
1. flexbox can move items in all directions while float only moves in two
2. It makes using Css faster and easier so less time is spent making it look pretty so more time can be put towards functionality
