# Class 06

Having us read on new topics before teaching them is a good way to make sure we learn the concept and come to class with questions on the topic 

**JS objects**

1. an object is a collection of related data and functions
2. literally writing out the objects contents
3. instead of accessing a certain point in an array like: array[1][0] you would write object['name']['first']
4. when the object is dfined at runtime
5. 'this' is refering to the object 'dog', an advantage of this is its faster than using an array

**The DOM**
document object model
1. The DOM represents documents as nodes and objects so programming languages can interact with the page.
2. The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.
