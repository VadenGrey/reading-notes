Going over more of the basics and something new: arrays, wrote more about that because it was new to me

**HTML**

1. An unordered list can be used for when the sequence of the list does not matter
2. by using the "type" atribute
3. an ordered list is used when the sequence of the list matters like instructions
4. with the "type" atribute or "start" to start at a specific number

**CSS**

1. margin is the space outside the border, and padding cushions the content inside the border
2. the sequence of the box model: margin, border, padding, content

**JS**

An array is a 'list-like-object' which can be a variable thats assigned many values like strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays.

JS array syntax:

```
let x = ['string', 1, 2, 'anotherstring'], [3, 4, null]
```

1. strings, numbers, objects, even other arrays
2. yes, by typing console.log(people[#])
3. *= multiplication, += addition, -= subtraction, /= division, **= exponent
4. 10dog, because false = 0 when converted to a number
5. conditional statements check to see if conditions are met then run the code thats enclosed within them, like checking if you guessed correctly on a prompt
6. for when you want to continue where you left off in a prompt if the user guessed incorrectly to give them another try
