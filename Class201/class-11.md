This reading assignment will be useful for future reference in putting images, sounds, and videos on websites

**Video and Audio Content**
1. video and audio started out with flash and silverlight but those had security and accessibility issues which made them obsolete in favor of native HTML solutions
2. src attribute is the source and controls add controls to the video in the browser
3. when the browser doesnt support the video file a fallback is used for older browsers
4. audio tags are for presenting audio snippets and video tags are for presenting videos

**The Grid**
1. not by much flex moves a box and grid makes a grid
2. grid container defines the size & shape of the grid, grid items are whats displayed in said grid, and grid lines are for separating those items in the grid

**Responsive Images**
1. to take up less bandwidth on devices that have a smaller screen
2. 

```
<img srcset="thing-480w.jpg 480w,
             thing-800w.jpg 800w"
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
            800px"
     src="thing-800w.jpg"
```
3. so the browser can pick which image to display
