**Component-based Architecture**
1. A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
2. Reusability,Replaceable,Not context specific,Extensible,Encapsulated,Independent
3. Ease of deployment,Reduced cost,Ease of development,Reusable,Modification of technical complexity,Reliability,System maintenance and evolution,Independent

**Props & how to use in React**
1. properties
