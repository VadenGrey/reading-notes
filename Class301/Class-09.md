1. Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
2. It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic), also It does not cause any observable side effects
