**Thinking in react**
1. a component should ideally do only do one thing
2. type out what you want your site to look like with no interactability
3. make it react
4. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
5. figure out where you need data to flow down to

**Higher order functions**
1. Functions that operate on other functions
2. taking a variable and seeing if it is greater than another variable, returning either thruthy or falsey
3. map is a function that uses another function, then executing for each variable in an array
