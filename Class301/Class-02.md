# Class 02

These reading notes go over react and components, something we are starting out with in 301

**React lifecycle**
1. render
2. constructor
3. constructor, render, ReactUpdates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount
4. loads anything using a network request or initializes the DOM

**React State Vs Props**
1. props are like arguments to a function
2. state is handled inside a component while props are handled outside
3. when the state changes for a component
4. a counter, form, and things that change

**things I want to know more about**
