**API Design Best Practices**
1. Representational State Transfer
2. resource
3. A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:

```
https://adventure-works.com/orders/1
```

4. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
5. URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).
6. 

```
https://adventure-works.com/orders
```

7. bad, makes a lot of requests
8. HTTP status code 200 (OK).
9. 404 (Not Found).
10. HTTP status code 201 (Created).
11. HTTP status code 204 (No Content)
