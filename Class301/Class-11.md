1. SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database, SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores, SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data, SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, For the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data, SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language).
