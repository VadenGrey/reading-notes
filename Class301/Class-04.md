# Class 04

forms will be something to use later in class and ternary operators seem to be a faster way to write if statements

**React-docs forms**
1. a component that controls its own state
2. update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them
3. by assigning the input tag a name

**The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained**
1. takes up less space
2. 

```
x===y ? console.log('yes'): console.log('no');
```
