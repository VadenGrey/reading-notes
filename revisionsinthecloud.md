# Revisions on GitHub

**Version Control**
By utilizing a VCS(version control system) you can revert files to their previous versions.

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed(Data is securely stored in a local database), modified(File has been changed but not committed to the database) and staged.

## How to utilize git through the terminal

```
git clone "your repo link" 

git add "file name"
git commit -m "why did you make these changes"
git push origin main
git pull origin main
git status
```
