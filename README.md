## The Growth Mindset™
A growth mindset is the opposite of a fixed mindset where instead of shying away from challenges and saying: "I can't do this", you embrace challenges for an opportunity to grow and become smarter while beginning to say: "I will do this" 

### How to maintain said Growth Mindset™

* You will always start out not being good at things
* Failure is an opportunity to grow
* Trying a different strategy will help get you through a challenge
